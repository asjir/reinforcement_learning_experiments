# Reinforcement learning experiments

In order of completing these notebooks:

[Experiments on using XGBoost as Q-approximating function](Q_Learning.ipynb)

[Optimisng a simple heuristic which eventually solved the environment](BasicGenetic.ipynb)

[Further experiments on Q Learning and using a heuristic loss](CartParametrised.ipynb)

Also there's [another one](CartParametrised_Smart) where I used a heuristic instead of random exploration during training, but without any considerable success. Next thing I'd do is increasing batch sizes and look for optimal learning rate then.
